The project aims to create a Face Recognition-Based Attendance System using biometric authentication and machine learning to automate and secure attendance tracking in educational institutions, corporate offices, and healthcare facilities. The system uses unique physiological traits like fingerprints and facial features for identity verification, reducing errors, fraud, and time theft. The system architecture includes biometric data acquisition, preprocessing, authentication, and a web-based backend. The authentication module uses advanced matching algorithms for rapid verification. A user-friendly web interface allows administrators to enroll users, monitor attendance, and generate reports. The system is scalable, flexible, and future-ready, reducing risks of unauthorized access or data breaches. Hardware requirements include a web camera, Windows OS, RAM, processor, and storage, while software includes PHP, XAMPP, SQL, Biometric Libraries APIs, and Visual Studio Code.
